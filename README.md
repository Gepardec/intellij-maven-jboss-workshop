*Fixed, but maybe not so pretty* (csalmhof)

Try to fix the maven project!

you are only allowed to use intellij. no commandline. no git-bash. etc.

first create a feature branch with your name like. feature/hwirnsberger

you should be able to deploy the war archive in intellij to wildfly.
https://download.jboss.org/wildfly/17.0.1.Final/wildfly-17.0.1.Final.zip

you are on a good way if the test HelloWorldIT is green.

if you are satisfied with your solution push your branch
